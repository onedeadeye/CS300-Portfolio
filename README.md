# CS300-Portfolio

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- CS300, Data Structures Analysis and Design, required the analysis and design of data structures. Particularly, these projects involved designing a solution for storing and sorting a large number of relational data entries.
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- Of particular importance weas memory and runtime. This informed the decision to use a hash table over other options, as random-searches were prevalent in the primary use case.
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- I found significant assistance from the C++ standard library documentation and provided course materials.
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- After this project, I have a more complete perspective on algorithms and their place within broader computer science.
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I have noticed that even in my day job I am more attentive to patterns that impact memory and performance.
